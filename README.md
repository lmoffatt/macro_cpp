**Things I do for love of macro_dr and C++**

I wrote a lot of C++ code for macroR and later macro_dr.  
Along the way, I learned something about template programming, compile-time checking, and how to make C++ code more expressive and safer.  
Some of these solutions might be useful for the wider C++ community.

This is my place to share those ideas, recipes, and experiments.  
All content is open for discussion, improvement, or re-use.
